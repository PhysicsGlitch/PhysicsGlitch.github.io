This file contains the javascript app, index.html and json data for a plotly data visualization exercise that took a series of belly button data
from the Belly Button Diversity project: http://robdunnlab.com/projects/belly-button-biodiversity/.

Most of the javascript code is thoroughly commented in the file itself which explains each of the steps.

D3 and plotly were employed to link visualizations to be properly displayed in the html file.

The code includes a working dropdown menu that takes the index name of the participants and then produces a dashboard
that includes a bubble chart of bacteria data, a horizontal bar chart of the top 10 bacteria found in the participants belly button
and then various metadata that is displayed in a panel table. The dashboard also includes a gauge chart that indicates the wash frequency of the
participants.
